"""
Parser/writer for Darkstar One (Ascaron) .shd files.  v1.0

These sit next to .3do files in ds_3dobj/3DView/objects and hold a
STENCIL SHADOW VOLUME mesh: a separate, simplified, flat-shaded copy of the
object's silhouette geometry used to cast shadows. They are NOT shaders and
NOT textures. Not every .3do has one (small props / self-illuminated pieces
often don't).

Same reversed-4-byte-tag convention as .3do:
    "HWSV" -> stored "VSWH"   (HardWare Shadow Volume -- inferred, see SPEC.md)
    "SLOD" -> stored "DOLS"   (Shadow LOD)

Layout (CONFIRMED by byte-identical round-trip on all 24 sample files,
36 SLOD chunks, 800 bytes - 8.0 MB, both index widths):

  0x00  tag "VSWH" (== "HWSV")
  0x04  version string "00.1"
  0x08  u32 lod_count   -- CONFIRMED: number of SLOD chunks that follow.
                           Matches the companion .3do's LOD count exactly in
                           all 24 pairs (values of 1, 2 and 3 all observed).
  0x0c  u32 reserved (0 in every sample)
  then lod_count x SLOD chunk, back to back:
      +0x00  tag "DOLS" (== "SLOD")
      +0x04  u32 vertex_count
      +0x08  u32 index_count
      +0x0c  u32 index_width_flag -- CONFIRMED: 0 => uint16 indices,
                                     1 => uint32 indices. Earlier batches were
                                     all 0, which is why this looked reserved.
                                     Required once vertex_count > 65535
                                     (propsshape_16 has 102,942 vertices), but
                                     also used below that threshold
                                     (mainshapelod_157: 64,998 verts, still 32-bit).
      +0x10  vertex_count x 24-byte shadow vertex:
                 position   : 3 floats  -- occupies the same space as the
                                            render mesh; the shadow bbox
                                            reproduces the .3do's stored bbox
                                            exactly in 13 of 24 pairs and
                                            closely in the rest (the shadow
                                            hull is not a strict copy of the
                                            render hull, so do NOT rely on
                                            them being identical)
                 normal     : 3 floats  -- 94% are unit length; ~6% have other
                                            magnitudes and a handful are
                                            exactly zero. Treat this as a
                                            per-face extrusion vector, not a
                                            guaranteed unit normal.
      +...   index_count x (uint16 or uint32 per the flag), flat triangle list
      (no alignment padding observed. index_count is even in all 36 chunks
       seen, so whether .shd pads odd counts the way .3do does is UNTESTED.)

Shadow-volume construction (observed, for reference if you ever need to
generate one from scratch):
  - Positions are a position-welded subset of the render mesh (for
    gate_door_04: all 28 unique render positions are present, plus 1 extra).
    The shadow mesh is much coarser than the render mesh in vertex terms but
    has MORE triangles, because it includes the extrusion quads.
  - In simple meshes vertices are emitted in blocks of 6 sharing one face
    normal (clean in gate_door_04). This does NOT generalise: across the full
    corpus only ~15% of 6-vertex blocks share a single normal, so the real
    emission order is more complex and is NOT yet reverse-engineered.
  - The index buffer reuses vertices across blocks to stitch quad "walls"
    along shared edges (the classic silhouette-extrusion pattern).
  - Every file ends with a run of trailing vertices that NO index references
    (18 of 174 in gate_door_04; 36-540 elsewhere).
    Purpose unconfirmed -- most likely scratch space the runtime writes
    extruded/far-cap vertices into at draw time, which is why they're
    allocated in the file but never indexed. Preserved verbatim.

IMPORTANT for modding: because the shadow mesh is a separate mesh with its
own topology, editing a .3do does NOT update its .shd. See SPEC.md
"Shadow volumes and game compatibility" for what that means in practice.
